    "Encapsulation is the practice of wrapping data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a way of preventing accidental interference and misuse of data.  \n",

    "#### Why Use Encapsulation?\n",
    "1- Data Protection: Prevents direct modification of attributes.  \n",
    "2- Controlled Access: Allows controlled access using getter and setter methods.  \n",
