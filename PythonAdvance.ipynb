    "#### Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is the practice of wrapping data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a way of preventing accidental interference and misuse of data.  \n",
    "\n",

    "2- Protected Members: Defined using a single underscore (_). Can be accessed within the class and its subclasses but not directly from outside.  \n",
    "3- Public Members: No underscore. Accessible from anywhere.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Encapsulation?\n",
    "1- Data Protection: Prevents direct modification of attributes.  \n",
    "2- Controlled Access: Allows controlled access using getter and setter methods.  \n",
    "3- Flexibility and Maintainability: Changes to implementation can be made without affecting outside code.  \n"
